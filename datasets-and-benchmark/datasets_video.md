#### Youku-VESR

This dataset includes video samples, data description and evaluation codes. All HD videos come from Youku HD media database whose IP belongs to Youku itself. There will be more than 10K samples in Youku-VESR dataset, including the videos of different contents, different noise categories and different noise scales. This dataset will be released in 3 phases. The dataset for Youku VESR challenge 2019 is the 1st phase and it has 1k samples. 2k samples of 2nd phase will be released soon after the challenge. And in last phase, the left 7k+ samples will be opened to public.
