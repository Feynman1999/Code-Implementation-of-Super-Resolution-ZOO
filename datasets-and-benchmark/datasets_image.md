## Image datasets

#### SR-RAW

We have released our raw sensor dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UHKEUp77tiCZ9y05JtP6S9Tfo2RftK8m?usp=sharing). For each sequence, we capture 7 (few contain 6) images (RAW and JPG) taken by different focal lengths. One can train different levels of zoom models (e.g. 4X or 8X) using corresponding pairs within these sequences.

#### Waterloo

we establish a large-scale database named the Waterloo Exploration database, which in its current state contains 4,744 pristine natural images and 94,880 distorted images created from them.
